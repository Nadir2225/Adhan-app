# Adhan Reminder App

This project is an Android application designed to remind users of Adhan (prayer times) using Jetpack Compose for the UI. It includes alarm scheduling, location-based prayer time adjustments, a variety of Adhan sounds to choose from, and a Qibla compass for prayer direction. The application leverages WorkManager for scheduling alarms and ViewModel for managing data updates.

## Features

- **Alarm Scheduling with WorkManager**: The app uses WorkManager to schedule and manage Adhan notifications for each prayer time.
- **Location-Based Prayer Times**: Automatically adjusts prayer times based on the userâ€™s location, with location permissions managed dynamically.
- **Adhan Sound Selection**: A settings screen allows users to choose their preferred Adhan sound and preview it.
- **Qibla Compass**: Displays the direction of prayer.
- **Data Management with ViewModel**: Ensures smooth data flow and UI updates.
